# Reinforcement Learning for Grid Voltage Stability with FACTS
With increased penetration of renewable energy sources, maintaining equilibrium
between production and consumption in the worldâ€™s electrical power systems
(EPS) becomes more and more challenging. Through this project we aim to obtain voltage stability
in the EPS circuits using Reinforcement Learning. We implement q-learning, DQN and TD3 over a 2 bus system.
The project was carried out at ABB by Vishnu Sharma and Joakim Oldeen as a master thesis project. More information
 can be found here :

## Getting Started

Use the statement below to retreive the latest version of the project 
  ```
git clone https://github.com/thediavel/RL-ThesisProject-ABB.git
```
### Prerequisites

Project requires python 3.6, torch 1.4.0 and other packages mentioned in **requirements.txt** file.


### Installing

One can install all these dependencies using the pip command as shown below

```
pip install setuptools==41.0.0
pip install torch===1.4.0 torchvision===0.5.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to use the RL Agent
Once all the dependencies have been installed, we can begin the using different RL agents and see how they perform
```
from QLearning import qLearning
from DQN import DQN
from TD3 import TD3
```
```
qlAgent=qLearning(learningRate=0.001,decayRate=0.1,numOfEpisodes=48000,stepsPerEpisode=6,epsilon=1,annealingConstant=0.98,annealAfter=400)
dqnAgent=DQN(2, 0.001, 2000, 64, 0.7, 10000, 12, 1, 0.98, 100, 200, True)
td3Agent=TD3(2, lr=0.001, memorySize=2000, batchSize=64,  decayRate=0.1, numOfEpisodes=50000, stepsPerEpisode=12,tau=0.005,policy_freq=2,updateAfter=2)
```

## Running the tests

We can use the comparePerformance method to analyse how the algorithms perform on a common test set
```
qlres.comparePerformance(steps=600, oper_upd_interval=6, bus_index_shunt=1, bus_index_voltage=1, line_index=1, benchmarkFlag=True)
dqnres.comparePerformance(steps=600, oper_upd_interval=6, bus_index_shunt=1, bus_index_voltage=1, line_index=1, benchmarkFlag=True)
td3res.comparePerformance(steps=600, oper_upd_interval=6, bus_index_shunt=1, bus_index_voltage=1, line_index=1, benchmarkFlag=True)
```
